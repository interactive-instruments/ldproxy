# Migration

The syntax and structure of configuration files will change over time. Deprecations can happen in any minor version, major versions will remove all deprecated options and might introduce other breaking changes.

To keep your configurations up-to-date you can use the CLI tool `xtracfg`. It allows you to check your configurations for deprecated options and errors and can also automatically upgrade your configurations to the recent version.

::: info
The CLI tool `xtracfg` was not published yet. A link will be added here when it gets published in the coming weeks.
