# Editor

The ldproxy editor is a new web application based on _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ for creating and editing configurations. Just like the manager it allows to automatically generate configurations from data sources. The actual editing happens directly in the YAML files with syntax checks, auto-completion and tooltips.

A preview version of the editor will be available soon, follow the repository on [Github](https://github.com/ldproxy/editor) to stay informed.

For the future an extension for the desktop version of _Visual Studio Code_ is planned.
