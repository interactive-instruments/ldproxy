usability for existing WFS services\nDid you ever wish you could access WFS services with a simple RESTful JSON API? Or that you could just click your way through the data in the browser to find out if it is interesting for you?\nldproxy is an adapter that sits in front of existing WFS services and provides a simple RESTful API and additional output formats like GeoJson, HTML and JSON-LD. These representations are created on the fly using live data from the WFS.\nldproxy was designed with the goal to enhance existing WFS services with the ideas from the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices as well as the Data on the Web Best Practices developed by the W3C. In the meantime the OGC published the first draft of the WFS 3.0 specification, which also builds on these best practices and is mostly implemented by ldproxy.\nA demo is available at www.ldproxy.net, the source code is on GitHub. ldproxy is available under the MPL 2.0.\n"},"manual/00-deployment.html":{"url":"manual/00-deployment.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Deploying ldproxy\nThe recommended way to deploy ldproxy is using Docker, an open source container platform. Docker images for ldproxy are available on Docker Hub. \nPrerequisites\nTo deploy ldproxy, you will need an installation of Docker. Docker is available for Linux, Windows and Mac. You will find detailed installation guides for each platform here.\nInstalling and starting ldproxy\nTo install ldproxy, just run the following command on a machine with Docker installed:\ndocker run -d -p 7080:7080 -v ldproxy_data:/ldproxy/data iide/ldproxy:latest\n\nThis will download the latest stable ldproxy image, deploy it as a new container, make the web application available at port 7080 and save your application data in a Docker provided directory outside of the container.\nInstead of using a Docker provided directory where ldproxy will store its data (i.e. \"ldproxy_data) you may specify an absolute path, for example:\ndocker run --name ldproxy -d -p 7080:7080 -v ~/docker/ldproxy_data:/ldproxy/data iide/ldproxy:latest\n\nWe additionally added --name ldproxy to change the name of the docker container from a random name to \"ldproxy\".\nYou may also change the host port or other parameters to your needs by adjusting the commands shown on this page.\nTo check that the docker process is running, use\ndocker ps\n\nwhich should return something similar to\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES\n62db022d9bee        iide/ldproxy:latest   \"/ldproxy/bin/ldproxy\"   16 minutes ago      Up 16 minutes       0.0.0.0:7080->7080/tcp   ldproxy\n\nCheck that ldproxy is running by opening the URI http://localhost:7080/ in a web browser.\nIf ldproxy is not responding, consult the log with docker logs ldproxy.\nUpdating ldproxy\nTo update ldproxy, just remove the container and create a new one with the run command as above. For example:\ndocker stop ldproxy\ndocker rm ldproxy\ndocker run --name ldproxy -d -p 7080:7080 -v ~/docker/ldproxy_data:/ldproxy/data iide/ldproxy:latest\n\nYour data is saved in a volume, not in the container, so your service configurations will still be there after the update.\n"},"book/01-managing-services.html":{"url":"book/01-managing-services.html","title":"Usage","keywords":"","body":"Managing services\nldproxy provides a web application to manage services.

Clicking on the arrow shows the details why a service cannot be created. A typical issue are invalid or missing schemas.\n\nIf you click on the service in the service list, the detail view will be opened.\n\nTo start browsing the proxy service, click on View at the right. That will lead to the main page, which is generated from the WFS capabilities document.\n\n"},"book/03-adding-from-catalog.html":{"url":"book/03-adding-from-catalog.html","title":"Adding services from the catalog","keywords":"","body":"Adding services from a catalog\nldproxy can crawl CSW catalogs to find available WFS services.

We will use a CSW from Spain as an example: http://www.ign.es/csw-inspire/srv/eng/csw\n\nAfter clicking on Find services, ldproxy will get the available WFS services from the catalog. Before the services are added, it will show how many were found.\n\nAfter confirming to add the found services, you will see a progress chart which shows how many services were added successfully or could not be added.\n\nIf there were errors, a Show Errors button will appear. These example errors are from a different catalog.\n\nWhen returning to the services overview, the added services will appear.\n\n\n"},"book/04-editing-services.html":{"url":"book/04-editing-services.html","title":"Editing services","keywords":"","body":"Changing the service configuration\nUsing the ldproxy manager you can also change the configuration of proxy services. Here we will explain a few typical changes that are often helpful to improve how the feature data is displayed in the HTML pages.\nChange the label used to display a feature type to a more human friendly name\nFor example, let's change lands2:watertorens to Watertorens. \nIn the detail view for the service, click on lands2:watertorens at the bottom.\n\nThis will open the detail view for the feature type. Change the  Display name from lands2:watertorens to Watertorens.\n\nChange the label used to display a property of a feature type to a more human friendly name\nFor example, change WOONPLAATS to Woonplats.\nIn the detail view for the feature type, click on landschapsatlas:WOONPLATS. This will open the mapping configuration for the property on the right.\nChange the  Name under text/html from WOONPLAATS to Woonplats.\n\nRemove an attribute from the overview pages\nFor example, disable that Foto_groot is shown in the overviews.\nIn the detail view for the feature type, click on landschapsatlas:Foto_groot. This will open the mapping configuration for the property on the right.\nDisable the switch for Show in collection under text/html.\n\nSuppress an attribute everywhere\nFor example, disable that OBJECTID is shown in the overviews and the page of each feature.\nIn the detail view for the feature type, click on landschapsatlas:OBJECTID. This will open the mapping configuration for the property on the right.\nDisable the switch for text/html.\n\nChange the label of a feature to a more useful name\nBy default, the label will use the gml:id of the feature as an identifier, which in many cases will be of no use for a user.\nFor example watertorens.1 will not be a useful name for a user. A better fit would be the name of the municipality.\nIn the detail view for the feature type, click on landschapsatlas:watertorens. This will open the mapping configuration for the feature type on the right.\nChange the  Name under text/html from {{id}} to {{Woonplats}}.\n\n"},"book/05-using-codelists.html":{"url":"book/05-using-codelists.html","title":"Using codelists","keywords":"","body":"Using codelists\nCodelists can be used to resolve coded values to human readable ones. \nAdding a codelist\nTo add a codelists, choose Codelists in the menu and click on the plus sign at the top.\n\nA dialog will appear where you can enter a codelist identifier and the URL of the codelists.

Additionally, if the JWT contains an expiration time in the exp claim, requests with expired tokens will be rejected.\nOther tokens (userInfoEndpoint)\nTokens may also be verified by sending them to a given endpoint by configuring an URL template, e.g. http://localhost/userinfo?access_token={{token}}. If the token is valid, a successful response with status code 200/204 is expected.\nExternal dynamic authorization (externalDynamicAuthorizationEndpoint)\nFor secured services, ldproxy supports dynamic authorization by an external endpoint using JSON based XACML (see http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/xacml-json-http/v1.0/xacml-json-http-v1.0.html and http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/xacml-rest/v1.0/xacml-rest-v1.0.html). \nFor a request with a valid token, a request with Content-Type application/xacml+json will be sent to the configured endpoint:\n{\n  \"Request\": {\n    \"AccessSubject\": {\n      \"Attribute\": [\n        { \"AttributeId\": \"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject:subject-id\", \"Value\": \"johndoe\" } \n      ]\n    },\n    \"Resource\": {\n      \"Attribute\": [\n        { \"AttributeId\": \"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id\", \"Value\": \"/collections/afeaturetype/items\" } \n      ]\n    },\n    \"Action\": {\n      \"Attribute\": [\n        { \"AttributeId\": \"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id\", \"Value\": \"POST\" },\n        { \"AttributeId\": \"payload\", \"Value\": \"e30=\" } \n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nA response with Content-Type application/xacml+json that permits or denies authorization is expected:\n{\n  \"Response\": [ {\n      \"Decision\": \"Deny|Permit\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nPostprocessing for POST/PUT (postProcessingEndpoint)\nFor services with POST/PUT/DELETE support, request bodies for POST/PUT requests may be passed through a postprocessing endpoint.
